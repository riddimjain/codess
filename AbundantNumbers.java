 * Example
Input : Number = 18
Output : Yes, It's an Abundant Number
Explanation : The Factors for the number 18 are, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9. We don't want to include the number itself.
Now the sum of the factors except the number itself is :
1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 = 21
as the number 21>18 , the number itself.
It's an abundant number.
